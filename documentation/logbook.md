### Methodology

We are working using Agile methodology. We are having daily meetings from Monday to Friday, each of them lasting around 4 hours or more. We meet up, discuss what we have done since last time, plans for the current session and start developing/working. Our meetings end with a brief discussion on what we will be focusing on next time.

### Preparation phase

*26.11.2019*\
First meeting with our project giver, Thomas, after exchanging some emails. We discussed multiple project ideas and ended up taking on Chestnut.

### Concept and design phase

Meetings between the 2 of us, discussed technologies, designs, concepts, wrote report, made work plan, discussed priorities, extra features, and so on.

**Week 4**

### Early development phase

**Week 5**

*27.01.2029*\
As we are pretty much done with the concept and design phase, we started working on the documentation. We looked at how we can organize and structure our report in a good manner.

*30.01.2020*\
We had a meeting with our supervisor, Thomas, and showed him our designs and concept ideas. After that, we discussed architectural designs and concepts such as hypermedia driven REST API (HATEOAS) and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). Later on, we had a meeting between the 2 of us and discussed these ideas. Those are great concepts that we will heavily consider moving forward and very likely include in our solution.
