# Design
We wanted to have a good idea of web-design of our application before moving on to the coding part of the project. 

In weeks four and five, we had several meetings where we discussed the different elements of web-design and how to use these elements to come up with a user-friendly design. Let us look at the elements of web design.

#### Do not make me think principle. book by Steve Krug
- All kinds of things on a Web page can make us stop and think unnecessarily. Take names, for example.
Typical culprits are cute or clever names, marketing-induced names, company-specific names, and
unfamiliar technical names.
    - Choose Clear Names


- Clickable Links and buttons. 
    - Should be obvious

- Fact of life #1:
    - We do not read pages. We scan them.




    

Distinct headers for text. h1, h2 ,h3 
-keep paragraphs short.
-using bullet points


### Number of clicks to get get anywhere
- number of clicks is a metric used by some websites
    - Number of clicks is not important as long as each click is painless and they (the user) have continuted confidence that they're on the right track.
